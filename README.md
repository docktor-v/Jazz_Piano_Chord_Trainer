# Jazz_Piano_Chord_Trainer
This JavaFX application takes control of a function MIDI keyboard and delivers training in Jazz chord progressions.

By following along with this tutorial using your own piano keyboard, you can learn how to  play the ii, V, I progressions in every key around the circle of fourths, without memorizing anything. 

After you learn the patterns, you'll be able to start at C major then work your way aroung the circle of fourths without any sheet music. You can use this for comping, improvising, and playing along to many jazz standards, as these chords are foundational in Jazz music.

I developed this app after attempting to learn these chords the hard way - rote memorizaion. It took a very long time. In fact, if I hadn't noticed the underlying pattern, I almost never would have just memorized the chords. The point with this app is to teach the pattern, and to save you the trouble of memorization.

At first, you may want to follow along on page 14 of the book "Intro to Jazz Piano" by Mark Harrison.

In this app, we focus on the right hand only. The left hand isn't too challenging to learn.

This project started with a basic synthesizer tutorial by Almas Baimagambetov  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AVgeN202jw&ab_channel=BrianDesign).
