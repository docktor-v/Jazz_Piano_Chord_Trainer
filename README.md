# Jazz_Piano_Chord_Trainer

This project started with a tutorial by Almas Baimagambetov to build a piano synthesizer using javaFX (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AVgeN202jw&ab_channel=BrianDesign)
After finishing the tutorial, I plan to add the black keys and then expand the tutorial into an animated lesson on the ii-V7-I7 chord progressions.
