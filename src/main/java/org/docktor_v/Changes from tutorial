Added black keys
Added click to play notes
Extended keyboard from one octave to three.
Allowed keyboard to be played with mouse clicked by:
    1. Converting the method "onKeyPressed" to "playKey" and its parameters changed from a KeyCode to just the key number (int). This meant that in the main start method, I had to get the note number from the keycode after the
       keycode event. This is the expression:
       scene.setOnKeyPressed(e ->playKey(notes.stream().filter(s->s.key.equals(e.getCode())).findFirst().orElse(null).number));
       The e.getCode is the actual listener from the keyboard. Initially, Java would not allow me to write this expression without using an Optional object. This is because, when a key is pressed, it may return an actual object
       of class Note, or it may not return anything at all. An Optional object is an object which may or may not contain a non-null value.
       Since I can't assign every key on the MIDI keyboard to an actual key on the keyboard, I didn't want anything to happen if a key was pressed that was not assigned to a key on the MIDI, so instead, I just
       added the orElse(null), and the .number returns the number to the playKey method.
